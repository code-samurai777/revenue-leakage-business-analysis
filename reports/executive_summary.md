1. Business Context

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace experiencing strong order growth. However, leadership suspects that revenue quality and customer retention may be weakening, leading to unsustainable growth driven primarily by acquisition.


2. Key Findings
   
2.1 Revenue Growth Is Volume-Driven

Monthly revenue increased primarily due to higher order volume, while Average Order Value (AOV) remained flat over time. This indicates that revenue growth is not driven by increased customer spend per order.

2.2 High First-Order Churn

A significant proportion of customers place only one order. Cohort analysis shows sharp drop-offs after the first purchase, with weak long-term retention across cohorts.

2.3 Operational Delays Are Linked to Lower Repeat Behavior

Customers experiencing delivery delays tend to place fewer subsequent orders. While this analysis is correlational, it suggests that logistics performance is a key driver of customer retention and lifetime value.

2.4 Revenue Is Concentrated Among a Small Seller Group

A minority of sellers contributes a disproportionate share of revenue, exposing the business to operational and concentration risk if these sellers underperform.


3. Recommendations

Improve first-order delivery reliability to increase repeat purchase probability.

Shift focus from low-value acquisition toward retention and repeat purchase incentives.

Monitor high-revenue sellers closely for delivery delays and operational issues.


4. Expected Impact (Directional)

Improving early retention and delivery reliability is likely to yield higher ROI than increasing acquisition spend, due to compounding effects on customer lifetime value.


5. Limitations

This analysis is based on historical transactional data and demonstrates correlations rather than causal relationships. Further experimentation (e.g., A/B testing delivery improvements) is required to confirm impact.
